# LayoutDIT
LayoutDIT is a layout-aware end-to-end document image translation framework. It effectively incorporates the layout information into DIT in an end-to-end way and significantly improves the translation for document images of diverse domains and layouts/formats in our experiments.

Our paper "LayoutDIT: Layout-Aware End-to-End Document Image Translation with Multi-Step Conductive Decoder" has been accepted by EMNLP 2023.

The code will be released soon.
