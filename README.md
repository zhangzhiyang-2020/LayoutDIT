# LayoutDIT
LayoutDIT is a layout-aware end-to-end document image translation (DIT) framework. It effectively incorporates the layout information into DIT in an end-to-end way and significantly improves the translation for document images of diverse domains and layouts/formats in our experiments.

Our paper [LayoutDIT: Layout-Aware End-to-End Document Image Translation with Multi-Step Conductive Decoder](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.673/) has been accepted by EMNLP 2023.

DITrans is a new benchmark dataset for document image translation built with three document domains and fine-grained human-annotated labels, enabling the research on En-Zh DIT, reading order detection, and layout analysis.
